# NodeSniper

A Minecraft username sniper made in Java.

# Why is it called NodeSniper, especially since it is made in Java?

# Why

Because.

## Alright, jokes aside:

This sniper was made because I just wanted to make a sniper for fun. It is also easy to use, platform-agnostic, and easily extensible.
